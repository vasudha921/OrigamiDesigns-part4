            Hi! I am Vasudha Bhat. I am 12 years old. 
            I love reading and writing poems.
            I also love coding. Coding is even more awesome when I am taught by Whitehat Jr.
            I like traveling, and I have been to many places in America. I also been to Dubai. 
            I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series too. I havent watched all the movies but I love the books.
            Reading about Harry Potter and other books helps me brainstorm and leads to bigger imaginations. 
            Watch my youtube videos and follow my Instagram profile. Have a nice day. 
      </p>

                    Rabbits practice a cute behavior know as "binky". 
                    They jump up in the air and twist and spin around! 
                   Rabbits are herbivores and eat mostly of grass and plants.

                 <ol>
                        Flowers did not always exist; they first appeared 140 million years ago.
                        Several centuries ago in Holland, tulips were more valuable than gold.
                        Broccoli is actually a flower.
